      <h2 class="questions">The following is my learing-plan and expectations from this cours</h2>
      <div class="answers">  <p >My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled professional who can manage tasks independently and find solutions to any issues faced. In terms of career pathways, I am looking to work in a field where I can utilise all of my experience and knowledge, while also finding enjoyment in my work and avoiding boredom. I strive to develop a career that is both challenging and fulfilling for me.<br><br>

          My strengths when it comes to learning include my strong work ethic and my ability to enjoy challenging work. I am a hardworking person who is dedicated to achieving my goals.<br><br>
          My limitations when it comes to learning include a tendency to get easily bored in routine settings, which can lower my productivity significantly. In order to maintain my concentration and engagement, I require a dynamic and stimulating learning environment. I need to be kept engaged and challenged to fully utilise my abilities and achieve my goals.<br><br>
          
          
          Some of the thing that I look to gain is being more outgoing.<br><br>
          
          
          During this program, I plan to manage my workload by staying focused, always aiming for my goals and keeping check on my progress. An essential part of success is being mentally prepared, so I have made sure that I know it is not an easy journey and there will be hardships. This will eliminate any surprises and create a realistic expectation that there will be bumps ahead.<br><br>
          When things get overwhelming, I plan to take a break, tune my brain off and relax. I will then contemplate my choices and the reasons why I chose this path, which will give me a push to continue pursuing my goals.<br><br>
          I also believe it is essential to take breaks regularly to keep my mind fresh. This is similar to clearing unnecessary data, which refreshes my mind when I return to the task and helps me identify any issues or solve problems I was stuck on.<br><br>
          I hope to make the most of this course and build friendships with other learners. Life is short, and I want to gain as much as I can from this experience.<br><br>
                   I plan to establish a system for addressing any challenges or difficulties I may encounter during my learning process. My approach will be as follows:
          <ul><li>
          When I am stuck or facing a problem, I will first take the time to clearly define and understand the issue.</li>
          <li>I will then attempt to find a solution by searching online and consulting relevant resources.</li>
          <li>If these initial efforts are unsuccessful, I will seek help from my fellow learners and facilitators. I will make sure that I reach out to them in a timely manner, to minimize any delays in my progress and maximize my chances of success.</li>
        </ul>
          I would expect the facilitators to provide a guidance on how to get to the solution of a problem rather than the answer. This will solidify the learning experience. If the problem is not solved, then i would appreciate a step by step tutorial.<br><br>
          Eventhough this cours is full on, it is important that i take time out for friends and family. This is a good way to reset my mind and get the mental support that i need. It is good to know that there are people around you who care about you which will releve any stress i would have. It is also a good way to review what i learned by explaining to family and friend about how hese stuff works.
