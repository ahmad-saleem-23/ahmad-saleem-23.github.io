      <h2 class="questions">Foundation Learning Plan</h2>
      <div class="answers">  <p >My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled professional who can manage tasks independently and find solutions to any issues faced. In terms of career pathways, I am looking to work in a field where I can utilise all of my experience and knowledge, while also finding enjoyment in my work and avoiding boredom. I strive to develop a career that is both challenging and fulfilling for me.</p><p>

          My strengths when it comes to learning include my strong work ethic and my ability to enjoy challenging work. I am a hardworking person who is dedicated to achieving my goals.</p><p>
          My limitations when it comes to learning include a tendency to get easily bored in routine settings, which can lower my productivity significantly. In order to maintain my concentration and engagement, I require a dynamic and stimulating learning environment. I need to be kept engaged and challenged to fully utilise my abilities and achieve my goals.</p><p>
          
          
          Some of the thing that I look to gain is being more outgoing.</p><p>
          
          
          During this program, I plan to manage my workload by staying focused, always aiming for my goals and keeping check on my progress. An essential part of success is being mentally prepared, so I have made sure that I know it is not an easy journey and there will be hardships. This will eliminate any surprises and create a realistic expectation that there will be bumps ahead.</p><p>
          When things get overwhelming, I plan to take a break, tune my brain off and relax. I will then contemplate my choices and the reasons why I chose this path, which will give me a push to continue pursuing my goals.</p><p>
          I also believe it is essential to take breaks regularly to keep my mind fresh. This is similar to clearing unnecessary data, which refreshes my mind when I return to the task and helps me identify any issues or solve problems I was stuck on.</p><p>
          I hope to make the most of this course and build friendships with other learners. Life is short, and I want to gain as much as I can from this experience.</p><p>
                   I plan to establish a system for addressing any challenges or difficulties I may encounter during my learning process. My approach will be as follows:
          <ul><li>
          When I am stuck or facing a problem, I will first take the time to clearly define and understand the issue.</li>
          <li>I will then attempt to find a solution by searching online and consulting relevant resources.</li>
          <li>If these initial efforts are unsuccessful, I will seek help from my fellow learners and facilitators. I will make sure that I reach out to them in a timely manner, to minimize any delays in my progress and maximize my chances of success.</li>
        </ul>
          I would expect the facilitators to provide a guidance on how to get to the solution of a problem rather than the answer. This will solidify the learning experience. If the problem is not solved, then i would appreciate a step by step tutorial.</p><p>
          Eventhough this cours is full on, it is important that i take time out for friends and family. This is a good way to reset my mind and get the mental support that i need. It is good to know that there are people around you who care about you which will releve any stress i would have. It is also a good way to review what i learned by explaining to family and friend about how hese stuff works.

    <h2 class="questions">Learning Plan for Boot Camp</h2>
    <div class="answers">
      <p> In general, my approach to learning for the Bootcamp will remain largely unchanged, with a slight emphasis on increased time management.</p>
      <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      This remains unchanged as my goals are long-term in nature.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>
      My strengths in Bootcamp will include my strong work ethic and ability to enjoy challenging work, as identified in my previous learning plan and goals. As for my limitations, it is difficult to predict at this stage, but I am confident that I will be able to manage them effectively. I am continuously making progress and hope to make the most of my Bootcamp experience.
    </p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>
      My biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will likely be maintaining my focus and avoiding burnout. While I tend to stay engaged and focused on a task until it's finished, this may prove difficult when working in a pair coding environment where I need to collaborate and share responsibilities with another individual. To overcome this challenge, I will need to work on balancing my workload and taking breaks to avoid burnout.
    </p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>
      I think I am okay to some extent in working with a group. However, I would like to be more efficient in working 1:1 closely with someone else.
    </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>
      It would be the same as Foundation, with more emphisise on tech support.
    </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
    <p>
      mainly for Bootcamp, i will have to refine my method for addressing any challenges or difficulties encountered during the learning process, and also be more open aboout seeking help from fellow learners and facilitators in a timely manner if needed.
