      <h2 class="questions">What is Emotional Intelligence (“EI”)?</h2>
      <div class="answers">  <p >EI was first identified in 1990 by researchers John Mayer and Peter Salovey. EI revolves around one's ability to recognise, understand and manage their emotions. EI include the ability of a person to identify and influence the emotions of people around them. Therefore, EI is divided into four components:<ul><li> self-awareness;</li><li> self-management;</li><li>social awareness; and</li><li>relationship management</li></ul></p>

    <h2 class="questions">How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>

    <div class="answers"><p> is what researchers use to measure both what people know and how quickly they can solve problems using reasoning. This test, however, does not account for the success of a person in life and does not cover the wide range of intelligence and people’s ability in different tasks.</p><p>
      This was when the concept of EI was discovered, where it focuses on the ability to identify and regulate emotion and to use social awareness in problem-solving.</p>
      <p>
      The following is a list of some of the IQ elements compared to the EQ elements:
      <ul><li> use logic to solve problems;</li><li> plan and strategise;</li><li>sunderstand abstract ideas; </li><li>learn and adapt to change; and</li><li>grasp and use language</li></ul>
      In comparison EQ wil be morre focused on the following:
      <ul><li> identify emotions in yourself and others;</li><li> empathize with other people;</li><li> adapt your feelings and behaviour to different situations;</li><li>control your impulses; </li><li>lwithstand temptations and delay gratification; </li><li>resolve conflicts with others;and</li><li>communicate effectively</li></ul>

    <h2 class="questions">Why is EQ important?
    </h2>
    
    <div class="answers"><p>
      There are many reasons why EI is important, as it helps with building your relationships, reducing your and your team's stress, defusing any conflict around you,t and improving your job satisfaction.</p><p>
      EQ is essential for effective communication and for any leadership position. It is important to have a high EQ if you wish to climb the employment ladder, as most successful leaders often have high EQ, and research have indicated the same.
