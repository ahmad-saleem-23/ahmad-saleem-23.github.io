      <h3>Simple problem, stress no more</h3>
      <p>The problem was a simple one, but it proved to be quite challenging. The code that I had written appeared to be in order, but one of the tests failed.</p>
      <p>In order to solve the problem, I took a step back and broke the code down into smaller blocks. This allowed me to better understand what was happening and to identify the root cause of the problem.</p>
      <p>Throughout the process, I felt a mixture of stress and frustration. It was tough not knowing what the actual issue was, but as I worked through each block of code, I felt more comfortable and confident. Eventually, I was able to identify the main issue and fix it.</p>
      <p>The experience taught me an important lesson: to take things easy and not to get too stressed out when faced with difficult problems. Sometimes, taking a step back and breaking the problem down into smaller pieces can help to solve even the toughest of challenges.</p>

      <h3>Solve problems elegantly</h3>
      <p>The problem was a string-to-array conversion that required various processing steps. The code looked fine and all of the required steps were present, but for some reason, it wasn't working.</p>
      <p>To solve the problem, I relied on two main problem-solving techniques. First, I read the error messages and the tests, as they provided important clues about what was going wrong. Second, I didn't lose track and kept my eye on the error messages, despite the potentially discouraging appearance of a block of red text.</p>
      <p>Throughout the process, I tried to maintain a focused and determined attitude. I realized that it was important not to get discouraged by the error messages, as they often hold the key to solving the problem.</p>
      <p>In the end, I solved the problem by finding a missing "s" in the '.split()' function. This experience taught me the importance of paying close attention to even the most tedious tasks, as the simplest solution may be hiding in plain sight.</p>

       <h3>Reflection</h3>
       <p>Reflecting on the use of various problem-solving techniques, I find pseudocode to be a useful and spontaneous tool when writing code. It allows for a natural flow while coding, and helps me make adjustments easily when needed.</p>
       <p>Trying something is another effective approach I use. When I am unable to find the solution, I try something similar which helps me simplify the issue.</p>
       <p>Reading error messages is a handy technique that I am getting used to as I progress in my development journey. It helps me understand the problems in my code and find solutions.</p>
       <p>I am also becoming more comfortable with using console.logging as a problem-solving technique. It provides valuable information and helps me debug my code.</p>
       <p>Lastly, googling is always a useful resource when I encounter difficulties. It provides a wealth of information and helps me find solutions quickly.</P>
