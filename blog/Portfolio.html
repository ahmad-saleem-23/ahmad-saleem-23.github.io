        <p>Hey there, I'm Ahmad! I'm a multi-passionate professional who recently made the jump into tech after practicing law for a while.</p>
        <p>I completed a software development bootcamp and now I'm excited to bring my diverse expertise to my next opportunity. I'm passionate about using my technical skills to develop innovative solutions and contribute to cutting-edge projects. </p>
        <p>When I'm not busy coding or advocating for my clients, you can find me exploring nature or trying out different cuisines with my friends. And if you need a good laugh, I won't deny that I have a bit of a meme addiction. Life is already chaotic enough, so let's embrace the mess and enjoy the ride!</p>

        <h1>SubMinder</h1>
        <p>I collaborated with a team of five others to develop a subscription and payment management site as part of our final project at Dev Academy. We had seven days to work on this project. The site includes secure Auth0 login, the ability to create, edit, and delete paid subscriptions or free trials, view upcoming and past payments, and sign up for email reminders. </p>
        <p>Please follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOkFt_XyzgU">Link</a> for the final project demo and presentation - subMinder (0 to 16 minutes).</p>
        <p>I have worked on building up the authentication system, including both the backend and frontend. This involved creating the sign-in page and handling all related queries. Additionally, I developed the add subscription page, along with the necessary backend components. I also implemented the feature to automatically store and populate payment events based on user-entered start and end dates. Finally, I was tasked with building an email reminder system, which required me to learn new technologies from scratch. Currently, I am working on adding the functionality for the email reminders to run in the background and check the database on a daily basis, without requiring users to sign in.</p>

        <h1>My Full Stack App:</h1>
        <p>
          I developed this app as part of a course project to showcase my skills in building a full stack app from scratch. The app allows users to browse their game library, edit game information, add new games, and delete existing ones. While the app is not yet deployed, I plan to continue refining it and adding user authentication features in the future. You can check out the app's GitHub repository via the link provided.

      <div class="third-project"><h1>Caption-This</h1>
      <p>
        I had the pleasure of being the product owner for Caption-This, a fun project I worked on with two colleagues during a bootcamp. Our goal was to build a game where users could add captions to random memes. We successfully completed the MVP within a 24-hour timeframe and it was a great experience working on something light-hearted and enjoyable.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we were able to achieve our initial goals, we had some exciting ideas for expanding the app's features. In the future, I plan to refine the user interface and create a voting system for users to compete for the funniest caption. I also want to enable users to add their own memes and import external APIs to provide more random images for captioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the app is not currently deployed, you can check out the GitHub repository at the link below to see the code and learn more about our process. I had a lot of fun working on this project and hope to continue developing it in the future.
