        <p>Hey there, I'm Ahmad! I'm a multi-passionate professional who recently made the jump into tech after practicing law for a while.</p>
        <p>I completed a software development bootcamp and now I'm excited to bring my diverse expertise to my next opportunity. I'm passionate about using my technical skills to develop innovative solutions and contribute to cutting-edge projects. </p>
        <p>When I'm not busy coding or advocating for my clients, you can find me exploring nature or trying out different cuisines with my friends. And if you need a good laugh, I won't deny that I have a bit of a meme addiction. Life is already chaotic enough, so let's embrace the mess and enjoy the ride!</p>

        <h1>SubMinder</h1>
        <p>I collaborated with a team of five others to develop a subscription and payment management site as part of our final project at Dev Academy. The site includes secure Auth0 login, the ability to create, edit, and delete paid subscriptions or free trials, view upcoming and past payments, and sign up for email reminders. </p>
        <p>Please follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOkFt_XyzgU">Link</a> for the final project demo and presentation.</p>
        <p>I have worked on building up the authentication system, including both the backend and frontend. This involved creating the sign-in page and handling all related queries. Additionally, I developed the add subscription page, along with the necessary backend components. I also implemented the feature to automatically store and populate payment events based on user-entered start and end dates. Finally, I was tasked with building an email reminder system, which required me to learn new technologies from scratch. Currently, I am working on adding the functionality for the email reminders to run in the background and check the database on a daily basis, without requiring users to sign in.</p>
