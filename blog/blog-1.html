      <h2 class="questions">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
        <p class="answers">Prior to my arrival in New Zealand, I was presented with a crucial decision in my life - on which side should I stand during a civil war in my home country. The complexity of the situation made it challenging to determine a clear stance, as both sides had valid arguments. However, the government's continuous human rights violations and oppression left me with no choice but to distance myself from any form of sedition, as such actions often resulted in familial conflicts and the severing of relationships, regardless of the impact of one's stance. <br><br>
          As a result, I have made it a personal principle to maintain a distance from any form of gossip or disputes, in both my personal and professional life.

      <h3 class="questions">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
       <p class="answers">I always find that a person will absorb the environment around them. This highlights the impact that the actions of the government, society and the people around you have had on shaping your values and identity.<br><br>
        The experiences you have gone through, such as the civil war and the government's oppression in my home country, have shaped your views on human rights and the importance of ethical decisions.<br><br>
        I often choose to distance myself from conflicts and avoid taking sides; This is a reflection to the value of peace and striving to make ethical decisions in difficult situations.

      <h4 class="questions"> Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h4>
       <p class="answers">I think my limitation is that I get bored really fast, which affects my enthusiasm if there is nothing to keep me engaged and push me forward. <br><br>
        Firstly, in many cases, I find it challenging to stay focused and motivated during extended periods of learning, such as in traditional classroom settings or when studying independently. Additionally, this limitation may make it challenging to stick to a specific learning plan, especially if the material is not presented in an engaging or interactive way.<br><br>
        Secondly, this limitation can also affect my career development by making it difficult for me to maintain motivation and focus in my field of work, which could lead to a lack of progress and difficulty climbing the career ladder.<br><br>
        To overcome this limitation, it is important that I find ways to keep myself engaged and motivated during the learning process. This may include finding interactive and engaging ways to learn, such as through hands-on projects, group work, or online courses. Additionally, it may be helpful to set specific and achievable goals and to regularly track your progress to keep me motivated.<br><br>
        It could also be helpful to seek out and work in roles or fields that are more engaging and require ongoing challenging work to align with my interests. <br><br>
        Overall, it is vital to identify and address this limitation to make the most of my learning and career development opportunities.

      <h5 class="questions">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h5>
       <p class="answers">One example of when I was trying to work productively with others but faced resistance was when I was working on a group research project. One of the group members always rejected any suggestions I made, and we couldn't reach a common ground. At the time, I tried to negotiate with them and explain my point of view, but they were unwilling to listen or consider my ideas.<br><br>
        I eventually sought the help of a mediator, who tried their best to facilitate an outcome, but the situation was still not resolved. Through this experience, I learned that compromise is essential when dealing with disputes and that it's important to be able to communicate effectively and emphasize my own point of view.<br><br>
        Looking back, I realise that I could have taken a more assertive approach in standing up for my ideas and finding ways to present them in a more compelling manner. In the future, I would try to establish clear communication and set expectations for the group at the beginning of the project, and also try to understand the other person's perspective, and try to work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.<br><br>
        I also realised that, when faced with resistance or tension, it is important to try to understand the reasons behind the other person's behaviour and to be patient and try to find a solution that works for everyone. And, if the situation can't be resolved, it is important to learn to let go and move on.<br><br>
