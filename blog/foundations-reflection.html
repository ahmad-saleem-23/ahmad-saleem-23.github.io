      <h2 class="questions">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <div class="answers">  <p >I realised that I placed too much emphasis on learning technical skills compared to the core part of the course. I think I was still stuck in the mentality that learning how to code was all that mattered.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, learning these topics was challenging and time-consuming, which is what I thought at first. However, now that I look at it, I think it will have its own benefits in the long run.</p>
        <p>Finally, it helped broaden my concept of listening to others, through the listening and looping exercises.</p>

    <h2 class="questions">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

    <div class="answers"><p> Values, empathy, and self-awareness are essential elements in learning and programming. They help individuals to develop a strong foundation that is important for success in both personal and professional life.</p>
    <p>
      The values provide a framework for individuals to prioritise their goals and improve their decision-making skills. Empathy, on the other hand, is crucial as it involves understanding the user's perspective, which helps to create software that meets their needs. As well as understanding your team members, thus improving efficiency. Finally, Self-awareness is essential in programming because it helps individuals to identify their strengths and weaknesses and take steps to improve their skills. Moreover, it is what builds self-confidence and promotes a growth mindset.

    <h2 class="questions">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h2>
    
    <div class="answers"><p>
      The amount of research that has been conducted in relation to the skills and other factors associated with Core Learning is impressive. Initially, I only saw the technical side of programming and did not pay attention to other important factors. However, I have since realised that progress is occurring on all fronts, whether it is the human side or the machine side.</p>
    <p>
      I was surprised to learn that it is possible to develop your workflow and skills by paying attention to core learning. Focusing on the fundamentals helps to build a strong foundation and improve the technical skills that are necessary for success in programming.

    <h2 class="questions">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h2>
    
    <div class="answers"><p>
      Staying focused on the core and not thinking about the tech part.

    </p></div>

    <h2 class="questions">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    
    <div class="answers"><p>
      These skills are just as important as technical skills in web development and can impact the way you approach and solve problems, communicate with others, and handle challenges in the workplace.

    </p></div>

    <h2 class="questions">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    
    <div class="answers"><p>
      In the long run, this time spent on core learning will pay off and enhance my overall performance as a programmer.
